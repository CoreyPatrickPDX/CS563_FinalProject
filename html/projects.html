            This project was for a graduate software engineering course to
            practice software engineering principles. The program is a python
            app that uses a GUI to allow a user to input a game then it accesses
            two website API's, Steam and GOG, figures out which site the game is
            cheaper on, let's the user know and displays a link to the webpage
            for the game. The GUI uses the PySimpleGUI library and isn't too
            involved. I wanted to do this project to better understand how to
            access an API and manipulate it's data, as well as create an
            application with something other than WPF.

          <p class="name">Unity Platformer</p>
          <p>Language: C# (Unity Framework)</p>
          <p>
            I created a 2D platformer in the Unity Framework Engine to
            understand game development a little bit better. It only consists of
            two levels, each with separate level designs, skyboxes, and music.
            It also has a main menu and a pause menu. The player is able to
            traverse levels with hazards, one-way and two-way platforms, as well
            as some moving platforms. The goal is to reach the flag at the end
            of the level while collecting coins along their path and from
            blocks. The player is able to move on the x-axis as well as jump
            along the y-axis. There is also gravity implemented so the player
            arcs through the air if moving while jumping. The player can also
            wall-jump and slowly slide down walls as if there were friction.
