        Hi! My name is Corey Patrick and I'm currently a graduate computer
        science student at Portland State University. As well as going to
        school, I work full time as a software engineer for Intel. Before
        working in my current position I still worked for Intel as a Low Yield
        Analysis manufacturing technician. I had a Bachelors of Science in
        Physics which helped me a lot in that role but I found that I enjoyed
        writing code and problem solving problems with code better suited me.
        For work I mostly code in C# for WPF applications as well as some html
        for web development. I've learned quite a bit more in school covering
        topics in C++, C, Python, JavaScript, and more developing solutions for
        problems my professors come up with. I'm hoping to focus on full stack
        development for both web and non-web apps to continue excelling at work,
        as well as going over machine learning and artificial intelligence
        topics when I can.
